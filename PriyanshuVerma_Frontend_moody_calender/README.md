# 🧠 Moody Tracker Calendar

A simple React app to help you track your daily moods using a calendar interface.  
You can select from three moods each day: Happy 😊, Sad 😢, or Neutral 😐. Your mood data is saved locally in the browser (`localStorage`), and weekly mood summaries are displayed using pie charts.
