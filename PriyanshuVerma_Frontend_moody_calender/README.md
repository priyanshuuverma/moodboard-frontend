# 🧠 Moody Tracker Calendar

A simple React app to help you track your daily moods using a calendar interface.  
You can select from three moods each day: Happy 😊, Sad 😢, or Neutral 😐. Your mood data is saved locally in the browser (`localStorage`), and weekly mood summaries are displayed using pie charts.

I built the **Moody Tracker Calendar** using React to provide users with a simple and interactive way to track their daily emotions—Happy 😊, Sad 😢, or Neutral 😐—through a calendar interface. 

I implemented mood selection logic using React’s `useState`, and ensured persistence by saving mood data in `localStorage`, allowing it to remain intact even after page reloads.
The calendar dynamically generates based on the selected month and year, and users can easily navigate through months. To enhance the experience, I integrated `Chart.js` with `react-chartjs-2` to display weekly mood summaries as pie charts, giving users a visual representation of their emotional patterns.
Styling was handled with Tailwind CSS to keep the design clean, responsive, and user-friendly. This project was a great way to sharpen my skills in React hooks, state management, date handling, local storage, and data visualization—all while creating something meaningful and engaging.
